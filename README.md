# Investigation of TMDb Movie Data

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to essentially analyze a dataset from The Movie Database (TMDb), which is a popular database that contains an abundance of data from a large set of movies over the years. I analyzed this data using the Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries in python. I analyzed this dataset to specifically answer certain questions that I posed about the data. This dataset was pulled from Kaggle and is my very first project using pandas to analyze data.

## Questions for the analysis

- Question 1: Which genres of movies are the most popular overall? 


- Question 2: Which genres account for the most movies?


- Question 3: Which movie was the most profitable each year?


- Question 4: What is the trend of the total profit of the movie industry over time?


- Question 5: Which actors have acted in the most movies?

## Which libraries are needed for this project?

- Pandas


- NumPy


- Matplotlib


- csv

## What did I learn?

Throughout this project, I learned how to navigate through the individual steps for exploratory data analysis. I gathered the data, observed the general properties of the data, cleaned the data, analyzed the data, and created visualizations of the results. I have gained a great familiarity with pandas and other libraries to handle data. I was able to work with datafames and series from pandas to find ways to answer all of the posed questions. I also had practice with clearly communicating my findings. The results of this analysis contained interesting insights of the movies in the dataset for the posed questions stated above.
